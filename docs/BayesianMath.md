# Bayes Theorem and Its Utility

This document is designed to discuss and elaborate on Bayes Theorem. It is meant to be simple, yet *useful*. Bayes theorem plays an enormous role in the logic of probability, and seems increasingly (and *justifiably*) important in advances in statistical knowledge. This particular discussion, however is motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the blizzard of statistical writing about it.

## Bayes Theorem

The basic statement of Bayes Theorem is:

$$P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B)*P(A)}{P(B)}$$

This simple equation holds a lot of importance and utility.

## Additional Terms

There are two other important terms that will arise often in this discussion: sensitivity and specificity. I will define and discuss these terms below (in a *brief* way).

### Sensitivity

Sensitivity of a diagnostic test is defined as the probability that a test will correctly identify a condition. That is, if a test has a sensitivity of 0.9 that means that 90% of all patients that have the condition will test positive, 10% will test negative (falsely). Thus, sensitivity is the probability of a true positive.

Sensitivity measures *correct positive results*. That means that a ‘sensitive’ test will correctly identify people who have the disease (within the Bayesian caveats below).

### Specificity

Specificity is defined as the probability that a negative result is correct. (P!A|B) is correct.

Specifity measures correct negatives. That means that a ‘specific’ test will accurately identify people *without* the disease.

### Summary

*Sensitivity measures positive accuracy*, *specificity measures negative accuracy*.
